    I'm a software engineer with years of experience building web applications
    at scale. Most recently I was at PayPal working as a full stack engineer on
    their Node.js layer. There I learned how to move quickly, and have an impact
    on products used by hundreds of millions of users. I led large-scale
    releases for new features (pushed alongside international marketing
    campaigns, and Time Square billboards), refactored legacy applications, and
    interviewed and trained new hires.

    In my early career I was a designer working in print and digital.
    Eventually, I started focussing on web design exclusively. As autodidact as
    they come, I became too curious about how to get the web apps I was
    designing to work myself, and so I dug deeper and deeper into the software
    realm. This years long journey brought me through the basics of programming,
    client side patterns and frameworks, building reliable server-side
    applications at scale, and most recently to best practices for data-oriented
    distributed systems (database tradeoffs, availability patterns, etc).

    My previous experience enables me to switch painlessly between service-level
    scalability discussions, client and server JS patterns, and even Photoshop
    documents. I love working on teams where I’m integral to many parts of an
    app. That said, depending on the opportunity I’m happy to sit exclusively in
    a single domain whether it’s client-side or services.
