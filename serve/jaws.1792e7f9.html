    This is an example of a work “side-project” that inspired by seeing a
    persistent pain point for a lot of engineers. This is an internal tool I
    designed and built with a team member allows you to quickly spin up
    stage accounts for testing purposes. The existing tool left a lot to be
    desired, to say the least. This tool created accounts with a single click,
    and allowed you to save and share complicated account types easily. After a
    couple of weeks, or so, we were able to share our solution with our
    organization and got good adoption for the new tool.
