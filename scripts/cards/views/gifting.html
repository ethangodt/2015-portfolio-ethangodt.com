    I was fortunate to lead the development of a new gifting feature for our
    main P2P application. It is one of the most engaging client-side projects
    Iâ€™ve ever worked on. The initial launch featured holiday cards to attach to
    transactions designed by the famous designer, Jonathan Adler.

    Our commitment to the project gave us just under a month and a half to push
    something to production before the holidays. It was an extremely tight
    deadline, but we pulled it off. The cards are animated with React Motion,
    and CSS 3D transforms. It was a fun experience to see my work on Time Square
    billboards, and in morning news broadcasts during the initial week of
    release.
