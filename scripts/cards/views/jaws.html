    Our team prioritized the freedom to address general pain points unrelated to
    our product. Of the various issues I worked on, this tool was one of my
    favorites. This is an internal tool I designed and built with a team member
    which allows you to quickly spin up stage accounts for testing purposes.

    The existing tool left a lot to be desired, to say the least. This tool,
    though, created accounts with a single click, and allowed you to save,
    share, and recreate custom account types easily. It was built with Electron
    (not the fastest for the CPU :), but it allowed us to build it quickly) so
    we could add global keyboard shortcuts to create and paste new account
    emails into staging apps on the fly. After a couple of weeks, or so, we were
    able to share our solution with our organization and got good adoption for
    the new tool.

    Itâ€™s important to me to be given the autonomy to explore opportunities not
    directly related to the product.
