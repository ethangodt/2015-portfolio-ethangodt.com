<div class="card unloaded negative"> <img src="/portfolio/send.c6a2d61e.png"> <p style="margin-top:0!important;"> At PayPal, I worked on a team which owned the web experience of all P2P products. This includes sending money to friends and family, special PayPal.me accounts, and Money Pools (funds which can be used for vacation, group-sharing Christmas gifts, or for fundraisers). We supported tens of millions of unique users every month. I worked closely with designers and product managers to grow the service globally, and to add new major features. In addition to product work, I interviewed and trained new hires and gave regular presentations about internal technology. </p> <img src="/portfolio/money-pools.f4a80d1f.png">
