<div id="about-card" class="card unloaded"> <img class="float" src="/ethan-sand.ff5d66f1.jpeg"> <p> I'm a software engineer with years of experience building web applications at scale. Most recently I was at PayPal working as a full stack engineer on their Node.js layer. There I learned how to move quickly, and have an impact on products used by hundreds of millions of users. I led large-scale releases for new features (pushed alongside international marketing campaigns, and Time Square billboards), refactored legacy applications, and interviewed and trained new hires. </p> <p> In my early career I was a designer working in print and digital. Eventually, I started focussing on web design exclusively. As autodidact as they come, I became too curious about how to get the web apps I was designing to work myself, and so I dug deeper and deeper into the software realm. This years long journey brought me through the basics of programming, client side patterns and frameworks, building reliable server-side applications at scale, and most recently to best practices for data-oriented distributed systems (database tradeoffs, availability patterns, etc). </p> <p> My previous experience enables me to switch painlessly between service-level scalability discussions, client and server JS patterns, and even Photoshop documents. I love working on teams where I’m integral to many parts of an app. That said, depending on the opportunity I’m happy to sit exclusively in a single domain whether it’s client-side or services. </p> <div class="skillsContainer"> <h3>Proficiencies</h3> <div class="iconContainer"> <div class="icon"> <img src="/linux-logo.e8f18c94.png" alt="Javascript Icon"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img src="/jsIcon.bf00a388.svg"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img src="/node-logo.5d8f7b9c.png"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img src="/postgres-logo.aa00cbdd.png" alt="Sass Icon"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img src="/react-logo.079f7d95.png" alt="Bootstrap Icon"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img src="/htmlIcon.e5059dfb.svg"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img style="width:45%;" src="/cssIcon.56244502.svg"> </div> <div class="icon"> <img src="/adobeIcon.662de8b9.svg" alt="Adobe Icon"> </div> </div> </div>
