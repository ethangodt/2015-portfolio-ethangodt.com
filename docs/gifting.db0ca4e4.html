It is one of the most engaging client-side projects Iâ€™ve ever worked on. The initial launch featured holiday cards to attach to transactions designed by the famous designer, Jonathan Adler. Our commitment to the project gave us just under a month and a half to push something to production before the holidays. It was an extremely tight deadline, but we pulled it off. The cards are animated with React Motion, and CSS 3D transforms. It was a fun experience to see my work on Time Square billboards, and in morning news broadcasts during the initial week of release. </p>
